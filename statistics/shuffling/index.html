	<p> The goal of this post is to explore shuffling algorithms and how to determine if it is random. We start with some utility functions and then proceed on to two different random shuffling algorithms. We compute some statistics on them and make sure they agree. THen we proceed to model various human-based shuffling methods.<p>
	
	<p> pickRange is a function that takes in two numbers and selects integers in between them. </p>

	<p> range is a function that takes in start, stop, increment and produces an array of numbers in between </p>
